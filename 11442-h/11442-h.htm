<h2>NEW BUILDINGS, INNER TEMPLE.</h2>
<div class="figure" style="width:60%;"><a href=
"images/405-1.png"><img width="100%" src="images/405-1.png" alt=
"New Buildings, Inner Temple" /></a></div>
<p>"The Temple," as our readers may be aware, is an immense range
of buildings, stretching from Fleet-street to the River Thames,
north and south; and from Lombard-street, Whitefriars, to
Essex-street, in the Strand, east and west. It takes its name from
having been the principal establishment, in England, of the Knights
Templars; and here, in the thirteenth century they entertained King
Henry III., the Pope's Nuncio, foreign ambassadors, and other great
personages. The king's treasure was accustomed to be kept in the
part now called the <i>Middle Temple</i>; and from the chief
officer, who, as master of the Temple, was summoned to Parliament
in the 47th of Henry III., the chief minister of the Temple Church
is still called <i>Master of the Temple</i>. After the suppression
of this once celebrated order,<a id="footnotetag1" name=
"footnotetag1"></a><a href="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a> the
professors of the common law purchased the buildings, and they were
then first converted into <i>Inns of Court</i>, called the Inner
and <i>Middle Temple</i>, from their former relation to Essex
House, which as a part of the buildings, and from its situation
outside the division of the city from the suburbs formed by Temple
Bar, was called the Outer Temple.</p>
<p>The principal part, or what we might almost call the nucleus of
the Inner Temple, is the Hall and Chapel, which were substantially
repaired in the year 1819. Thence a range of unsightly brick
buildings extended along a broad paved terrace, to the south,
descending to the Garden, or bank of the Thames. These buildings
have lately been removed, and the above splendid range erected on
their site, from the designs of Robert Smirke, Esq., R.A. They are
in the Tudor, or to speak familiarly, the good Old English school
of architecture, and combine all the picturesque beauty of ancient
style with the comfort and elegance of modern art in the adaptation
of the interior. Our succinct sketch of the origin of the Temple
will sufficiently illustrate the appropriateness of Mr. Smirke's
choice. Over the principal windows, on escutcheons, are the
Pegasus, the Temple arms, and the respective <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page418" name="page418"></a>[pg 418]</span> arms
of Henry III. and George IV. At the end immediately adjoining the
Chapel, is a Latin inscription with the date of the repairs, 1819,
and at the eastern extremity of the present building is another
inscription with the date of 1828, in which the last improvements
were commenced. Viewed from the Terrace, the whole range has a
handsome and substantial appearance, sufficiently decorated, yet
not overloaded with ornament. From another point, Whitefriars Gate,
the end of the building, with its fine oriel window, is seen to
considerable advantage. Against the old brick house on this spot
was a sun-dial, with the quaint conceit, "Begone about your
business." The cast-iron railing of the area appears to us
extremely elegant and appropriate.</p>
<p>The interior is not yet completed, but, by the courtesy of the
architect we have obtained a view of its unfinished state. The
principal apartments are the <i>Parliament Chamber</i> on the
first, and the <i>Library</i> on the second floor. The Chamber
adjoins the Hall, and is intended for a withdrawing-room, whither
the Templars of our times, after dining in the Hall, may repair to
exercise the <i>argumentum ad Bacculinum</i> in term time. The
dimensions of this room are in height about 13 feet; length 37
feet; and width about 27 feet. Above is the Library, which is
indeed a magnificent room. The height is about 20 feet; length 39
feet; and width in the centre about 37 feet. The fine window, of
which we spoke in our description of the exterior, is not yet
glazed; its height is 17 feet, and width 14 feet; and the mullions,
&amp;c. are very rich. The remainder of the buildings will be
occupied by ante-rooms, and chambers for barristers. The whole will
be fire-proof, the floors being divided by plate-iron archings upon
cast-iron bearings.</p>
<p>The Inner Temple Hall is a fine room, though comparatively
small. It is ornamented with the portraits of William III. and
Mary, and the Judges Coke and Littleton; it is also embellished
with a picture of Pegasus, painted by Sir James Thornhill. The
Middle Temple has likewise a Hall, which is spacious and fine: here
were given many of the feasts of old times, before mentioned. It
contains a fine picture of Charles I. on horseback, by Vandyke, and
portraits of Charles II. Queen Anne, George I. and George II.</p>
<p>There is a host of pleasing associations connected with the
Temple, if we only instance the seasonable doings there at
Christmas&mdash;as breakfasting in the hall "with brawn, mustard,
and malmsey;" and at dinner, "a fair and large Bore's head upon a
silver platter with minstralsaye."</p>
<hr />
<h3>SPRING TIDES.</h3>
<h4>(<i>For the Mirror.</i>)</h4>
<p>At page 310 of the present volume of your miscellany, your
correspondent <i>Vyvyan</i> states that the tide rises at Chepstow
more than 60 feet, and that a mark in the rocks below the bridge
there denotes its having risen to the height of 70 feet, which is,
perhaps (<i>Vyvyan</i> states), the greatest altitude of the tides
in the world. At Windsor, seated on the east bank of the
<i>Avon</i> river, which falls into the Basin of Mines, at the head
of the Bay of Fundy, the spring tides regularly rise 70 feet and
upwards; and at Truro, at the eastern extremity of the Bay of
Fundy, the spring tides rise to an altitude of 100 feet. There are
some parts of the west coast of North America also where the tides
rise to a very high altitude; but I do not at this moment remember
the particulars. My attention having thus been directed to the Bay
of Fundy, it induces me to inform you, that an inland water
communication, at a minimum depth of eight feet, and proportionate
expanse, is now forming from Halifax, <i>Nova Scotia</i>, by the
Shubenacadie river, falling into the Bay of Fundy, near the
abovementioned town of Truro.</p>
<p>The total length of this canal is 53 miles, 1,024 yards, the
artificial portion of which is only 2,739 yards, the remainder
being formed by a chain of deep lakes and the Shubenacadie river.
The summit level is 95 feet 10 inches above the <i>high-water</i>
surface of <i>medium tides</i> in Halifax harbour; and is attained
by seven locks, each 87 feet long, and 22 feet six inches wide; and
the tide locks nine feet in depth of water. The descent into the
Bay of Fundy, at highwater surface medium tides, is by eight
locks.</p>
<p>The estimated expense of this interesting work is
&pound;54,000.</p>

<h3>MINSTRELS.</h3>
<h4>(<i>To the Editor of the Mirror.</i>)</h4>
<p>Sir,&mdash;Sometime ago a discussion arose in the public papers
respecting the right of the King's Sergeant Trumpeter to grant
licenses to minstrels for carrying on their calling in London and
Westminster. I do not recollect whether <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page419" name="page419"></a>[pg 419]</span> this
officer succeeded in establishing the right; but the following
account of a similar privilege in another part of the country is
founded on fact, and may furnish amusement to some of your
readers:&mdash;</p>
<p>About the latter end of the reign of Richard I., Randal
Blundeville, Earl of Chester, was closely besieged by the Welsh in
his Castle, in Flintshire. In this extremity, the earl sent to his
constable, Roger Lacy, (who for his <i>fiery</i> qualities received
the appropriate cognomen of <i>hell</i>), to hasten, with what
force he could collect, to his relief. It happened to be
Midsummer-day, when a great fair was held at Chester, the humours
of which, it should seem, the worthy constable, witless of his
lord's peril, was then enjoying. He immediately got together, in
the words of my authority, "a great, lawless mob of fiddlers,
players, cobblers, and such like," and marched towards the earl.
The Welsh, although a musical people, not relishing this sort of
chorus, thought it prudent to beat a retreat, and fled. The earl,
by this well-timed presto-movement, being released from danger,
returned with his constable to Chester, and in reward of his
service, granted by deed to Roger and his heirs, authority "over
all the fiddlers, minstrels, and cobblers in Chester."</p>
<p>About the end of the reign of John, or the beginning of that of
Henry III., the fire of Roger being extinguished by death, his son
John Lacy, granted this privilege by deed to his steward, one Hugh
Dutton and his heirs, in the words following:&mdash;"Dedi et
concessi, et per hac presenti charta mea, confirmavi Hugoni de
Dutton, et heredibus suis, magistratum omnium lecatorum, et
<i>meretricum</i>, totius Cestershiriae," &amp;c.</p>
<p>Dugdale relates in his Monasticon, p. 860, that "under this
grant, and by ancient custom, the heirs of Dutton claim and
exercise authority over all the common fiddlers and minstrels in
Chester and Cheshire; and in memory of it, keep a yearly court at
Chester on Mid-summer-day, being Chester Fair, and in a solemn
manner ride attended through the city to St. John the Baptist's
Church, with all the fiddlers of the county playing before the Lord
of Dutton, and then at the court renew their licenses yearly; and
that none ought to use the trade or employment of a minstrel, or
fiddler, either within the city or county, but by an order and
license of that court." I find too that this privilege has received
the sanction of the legislature; for by the Act of 17 George II.,
cap. 5., commonly called the Vagrant Act, which includes
"minstrels" under that amiable class of independents, the rights of
the family of Dutton in the county of Chester are expressly
reserved. Perhaps some of your numerous Correspondents may be able
to say whether this very singular <i>Court of Concert</i> is still
kept up.</p>

<h3>ON GARDENS.<a id="footnotetag2" name=
"footnotetag2"></a><a href="#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a></h3>
<h4>(<i>For the Mirror</i>.)</h4>
<p>The hanging gardens, in antiquity called <i>Pensiles Horti</i>,
were raised on arches by Nebuchadnezzar, King of Babylon, in order
to gratify his wife, Amyctis, daughter of Astyages, King of Media.
These gardens are supposed by Quintus Curtius to have been equal in
height to the city, viz. 50 feet. They contained a square of 400
feet on every side, and were carried up into the air in several
terraces laid one above another, and the ascent from terrace to
terrace was by stairs 10 feet wide.</p>
<p>Among the Mexicans there are <i>floating gardens</i>, which are
described by the Abb&eacute; Clavigero, as highly curious and
interesting, so as to form a place of recreation and amusement. The
abundant produce of these prolific gardens, are brought daily by
the canal in numerous small vessels, at sun-rise, to the
market-place of the capital to be sold. The plants thrive in these
situations in an astonishing manner, the mud of the lake being
extremely fertile and productive, without the aid of rain. Whenever
the owners of these gardens are inclined to change their
situations, they get into their little vessels, and by their own
strength alone, or where that is not sufficient, by the assistance
of others, they get them afloat, and tow them after them wherever
they please.</p>
<p>Gardening was introduced into England from the Netherlands, from
whence vegetables were imported till 1509. Fruits and flowers of
sundry sorts before unknown, were brought into England in the
reigns of Henry VII. and VIII. from about 1500 to 1578. Grapes were
first planted at Blaxhall, in Suffolk, 1552. The ingenuity and
fostering care of the people of England, have brought under their
tribute all the vegetable creation.</p>
<p>Lord Bacon has truly observed, "A garden is the purest of all
human pleasures," and no doubt he felt its influence, when he
returned from the turmoil <span class="pagenum"><a id="page420"
name="page420"></a>[pg 420]</span> of a <i>court</i> and
<i>courts</i>. Many of his writings were composed under the shade
of the trees in Gray's Inn Gardens; he lived in a house facing the
great gates, forming the entrance to the gardens, and Sir Fulke
Greville, Lord Brook,<a id="footnotetag3" name=
"footnotetag3"></a><a href="#footnote3"><sup>3</sup></a> frequently
sent him "home-brewed beer." Epicurus, the patron of refined
pleasure, fixed the seat of his enjoyment in a garden. Dr. Knox
says, "In almost every description of the seats of the blessed,
ideas of a garden seem to have predominated. The word paradise
itself is synonymous with garden. The fields of Elysium, that sweet
region of poesy, are adorned with all that imagination can conceive
to be delightful. Some of the most pleasing passages of Milton are
those in which he represents the happy pair engaged in cultivating
their blissful abode. Poets have always been delighted with the
beauties of a garden. Lucan is represented by Juvenal as reposing
in his garden. Virgil's <i>Georgies</i> prove him to have been
captivated with rural scenes; though to the surprise of his readers
he has not assigned a book to the subject of a garden. But let not
the rich suppose they have appropriated the pleasures of a garden.
The possessor of an acre, or a smaller portion, may receive a real
pleasure from observing the progress of vegetation, even in the
plantation of culinary plants. A very limited tract properly
attended to, will furnish ample employment for an individual, nor
let it be thought a mean care; for the same hand that raised the
cedar, formed the hyssop on the wall."</p>
<p>P.T.W.</p>
<hr />
<h3>GRECIAN FLIES&mdash;SPONGERS.</h3>
<h4>(<i>For the Mirror</i>.)</h4>
<p>In modern days we should term <i>Grecian Flies, Spongers; alias
Dinner Hunters</i>. Among the Grecians (according to Potter) "They
who forced themselves into other men's entertainments, were called
<i>flies</i>, which was a general name of reproach for such as
insinuated themselves into any company where they were not
welcome." In Plautus, an entertainment free from unwelcome guests
is called <i>hospitium sine muscis</i>, an entertainment without
flies; and in another place of the same author, an inquisitive and
busy man, who pries and insinuates himself into the secrets of
others, is termed <i>musca</i>. We are likewise informed by Horus
Apollo, that in Egypt a fly was the hieroglyphic of an impudent
man, because that insect being beaten away, still returns again; on
which account it is that Homer makes it an emblem of courage.</p>

<h2>THE SELECTOR; AND LITERARY NOTICES OF NEW WORKS.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>MARSHAL NEY.</h3>
<p>[No apology is requisite for our introduction of the following
passage from the life of Marshal Ney, in a volume of the <i>Family
Library</i>, entitled "<i>The Court and Camp of
Buonaparte</i>."]</p>
<p>In the campaign of 1813, Ney faithfully adhered to the falling
emperor. At Bautzen, Lutzen, Dresden, he contributed powerfully to
the success; but he and Oudinot received a severe check at
Dennewitz from the Crown Prince of Sweden. From that hour defeat
succeeded defeat; the allies invaded France; and, in spite of the
most desperate resistance, triumphantly entered Paris in March,
1814. Ney was one of the three marshals chosen by Napoleon to
negotiate with Alexander in behalf of the King of Rome, but the
attempt was unsuccessful, and all he could do was to remain a
passive spectator of the fall and exile of his chief.</p>
<p>On the restoration of the Bourbons, Ney was more fortunate than
many of his brethren: he was entrusted with a high military
command, and created a knight of St. Louis, and a peer of
France.</p>
<p>But France was now at peace with all the world; and no one of
these great military chiefs could be more unprepared for the change
than the Prince of Moskwa. He was too old to acquire new habits.
For domestic comforts he was little adapted: during the many years
of his marriage, he had been unable to pass more than a very few
months with his family. Too illiterate to find any resource in
books, too rude to be a favourite in society, and too proud to
desire that sort of distinction, he was condemned to a solitary and
an inactive life. The habit of braving death, and of commanding
vast bodies of men, had impressed his character with a species of
moral grandeur, which raised him far above the puerile observances
of the fashionable world. Plain in his manners, and still plainer
in his words, he neither knew, nor wished to know, the art of
pleasing courtiers. Of good nature <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page421" name="page421"></a>[pg 421]</span> he had indeed a
considerable fund, but he showed it, not so much by the endless
little attentions of a gentleman, as by scattered acts of princely
beneficence. For dissipation he had no taste; his professional
cares and duties, which, during twenty-five years, had left him no
respite, had engrossed his attention too much to allow room for the
passions, vices, or follies of society to obtain any empire over
him. The sobriety of his manners was extreme, even to
austerity.</p>
<p>His wife had been reared in the court of Louis XVI., and had
adorned that of the emperor. Cultivated in her mind, accomplished
in her manners, and elegant in all she said or did, her society was
courted on all sides. Her habits were expensive; luxury reigned
throughout her apartments, and presided at her board; and to all
this display of elegance and pomp of show, the military simplicity,
not to say the coarseness, of the marshal, furnished a striking
contrast. His good nature offered no other obstacle to the
gratification of her wishes than the occasional expression of a
fear that his circumstances might be deranged by them. But if he
would not oppose, neither could he join in her extravagance. While
she was presiding at a numerous and brilliant party of guests, he
preferred to remain alone in a distant apartment, where the festive
sounds could not reach him. On such occasions he almost always
dined alone.</p>
<p>Ney seldom appeared at court. He could neither bow nor flatter,
nor could he stoop to kiss even his sovereign's hand without
something like self-humiliation. To his princess, on the other
hand, the royal smile was as necessary as the light of the sun; and
unfortunately for her, she was sometimes disappointed in her
efforts to attract it. Her wounded vanity often beheld an insult in
what was probably no more than an inadvertence. In a word she ere
long fervently regretted the court in which the great captains had
occupied the first rank, and their families shared the almost
exclusive favour of the sovereign. She complained to her husband;
and he, with a calm smile, advised her never again to expose
herself to such mortifications if she really sustained them. But
though he could thus rebuke a woman's vanity, the haughty soldier
felt his own wounded through hers. To escape from these complaints,
and from the monotony of his Parisian existence, he retired to his
country-seat, in January, 1815, the very season when people of
consideration are most engrossed by the busy scenes of the
metropolis. There he led an unfettered life; he gave his mornings
to field sports; and the guests he entertained in the evening were
such as, from their humble condition, rendered formality useless,
and placed him completely at his ease.</p>
<p>It was here that on the 6th of March he was surprised by the
arrival of an aide-de-camp from the minister at war, who ordered
him, with all possible despatch, to join the sixth division, of
which he was the commander, and which was stationed at
Besan&ccedil;on. In his anxiety to learn the extent of his
instructions, Ney immediately rode to Paris; and there, for the
first time, learned the disembarkation of Buonaparte from Elba.</p>
<p>Ney eagerly undertook the commission assigned him of hastening
to oppose the invader. In his last interview with Louis his
protestations of devotedness to the Bourbons, and his denunciations
against Napoleon, were ardent&mdash;perhaps they were sincere.
Whether he said that Buonaparte <i>deserved</i> to be confined in
an iron cage, or that he would <i>bring</i> him to Paris in one, is
not very clear, nor indeed very material.&mdash;We reluctantly
approach the darker shades in the life of this great officer.</p>
<p>On his arrival at Besan&ccedil;on, March 10th, he learned the
disaffection of all the troops hitherto sent against the invader,
and perceived that those by whom he was surrounded were not more to
be trusted. He was surrounded with loud and incessant cries of
<i>Vive l'Empereur!</i> Already, at Lyons, two members of the royal
family had found all opposition vain; the march of Napoleon was
equally peaceful and triumphant. During the night of the 13th, Ney
had a secret interview with a courier from his old master; and on
the following morning he announced to his troops that the house of
Bourbon had ceased to reign&mdash;that the emperor was the only
ruler France would acknowledge! He then hastened to meet Napoleon,
by whom he was received with open arms, and hailed by his
indisputed title of Bravest of the Brave.</p>
<p>Ney was soon doomed to suffer the necessary consequence of his
crime&mdash;bitter and unceasing remorse. His inward reproaches
became intolerable: he felt humbled, mortified, for he had lost
that noble self-confidence, that inward sense of dignity, that
unspeakable and exalted satisfaction, which integrity alone can
bestow: the man who would have defied the world in arms, trembled
before the new enemy within him; he saw that his virtue, his
honour, his peace, and the esteem of the wise and <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page422" name="page422"></a>[pg 422]</span> the
good, were lost to him for ever. In the bitterness of his heart, he
demanded and obtained permission to retire for a short time into
the country. But there he could not regain his self-respect. Of his
distress, and we hope of his repentance, no better proof need be
required than the reply, which, on his return to Paris, he made to
the emperor, who feigned to have believed that he had emigrated: "I
<i>ought</i> to have done so long ago (said Ney); it is now too
late."</p>
<p>The prospect of approaching hostilities soon roused once more
the enthusiasm of this gallant soldier, and made him for awhile
less sensible to the gloomy agitation within. From the day of his
being ordered to join the army on the frontiers of Flanders, June
11, his temper was observed to be less unequal, and his eye to have
regained its fiery glance.</p>
<p>The story of Waterloo need not be repeated here. We shall only
observe, that on no occasion did the Bravest of the Brave exhibit
more impetuous though hopeless valour. Five horses were shot under
him; his garments were pierced with balls; his whole person was
disfigured with blood and mud, yet he would have continued the
contest on foot while life remained, had he not been forced from
the field, by the dense and resistless columns of the fugitives. He
returned to the capital, and there witnessed the second imperial
abdication, and the capitulation of Paris, before he thought of
consulting his safety by flight. Perhaps he hoped that by virtue of
the twelfth article of that convention, he should not be
disquieted; if so, however, the royal ordinance of July 24th,
terribly undeceived him. He secreted himself with one of his
relatives at the ch&acirc;teau of Bessaris, department of Lot, in
the expectation that he should soon have an opportunity of escaping
to the United States. But he was discovered, and in a very singular
manner.</p>
<p>In former days Ney had received a rich Egyptian sabre from the
hands of the First Consul. There was but another like it known to
exist, and that was possessed by Murat. The marshal was carefully
secluded both from visiters and domestics, but unluckily this
splendid weapon was left on a sofa in the drawing-room. It was
perceived, and not a little admired by a visiter, who afterwards
described it to a party of friends at Aurillac. One present
immediately observed, that, from the description, it must belong to
either Ney or Murat. This came to the ears of the prefect, who
instantly despatched fourteen gensdarmes, and some police agents,
to arrest the owner. They surrounded the ch&acirc;teau; and Ney at
once surrendered himself. Perhaps he did not foresee the fatal
issue of his trial; some of his friends say that he even wished it
to take place immediately, that he might have an opportunity to
contradict a report that Louis had presented him with half a
million of francs, on his departure for Besan&ccedil;on.</p>
<p>A council of war, composed of French marshals, was appointed to
try him; but they had little inclination to pass sentence on an old
companion in arms; and declared their incompetency to try one, who,
when he consummated his treason, was a peer of France. Accordingly,
by a royal ordinance of November 12th, the Chamber of Peers were
directed to take cognizance of the affair. His defence was made to
rest by his advocates&mdash;first, on the twelfth article of the
capitulation, and when this was overruled, on the ground of his no
longer being amenable to French laws, since Sarre-Louis, his native
town, had recently been dissevered from France. This the prisoner
himself overruled; "I <i>am</i> a Frenchman, (cried Ney), and I
will die a Frenchman!" The result was that he was found guilty and
condemned to death by an immense majority, one hundred and
sixty-nine to seventeen. On hearing the sentence read according to
usage, he interrupted the enumeration of his titles, by saying:
"Why cannot you simply call me Michael Ney&mdash;now a French
soldier, and soon a heap of dust?" His last interview with his
lady, who was sincerely attached to him, and with his children,
whom he passionately loved, was far more bitter than the punishment
he was about to undergo. This heavy trial being over, he was
perfectly calm, and spoke of his approaching fate with the utmost
unconcern. "Marshal," said one of his sentinels, a poor grenadier,
"you should now think of God. I never faced danger without such
preparation." "Do you suppose (answered Ney) that any one need
teach me to die?" But he immediately gave way to better thoughts,
and added, "Comrade, you are right. I will die as becomes a man of
honour and a Christian. Send for the curate of St. Sulpice."</p>
<p>A little after eight o'clock on the morning of December 7th, the
marshal, with a firm step and an air of perfect indifference,
descended the steps leading to the court of the Luxembourg, and
entered a carriage which conveyed him <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page423" name="page423"></a>[pg 423]</span> to the place of
execution, outside the garden gates. He alighted, and advanced
towards the file of soldiers drawn up to despatch him. To an
officer, who proposed to blindfold him, he replied&mdash;"Are you
ignorant that, for twenty-five years, I have been accustomed to
face both ball and bullet?" He took off his hat, raised it above
his head, and cried aloud&mdash;"I declare before God and man that
I have never betrayed my country: may my death render her happy!
<i>Vive la France!</i>" He then turned to the men, and, striking
his other hand on his heart, gave the word,
"Soldiers&mdash;fire!"</p>
<p>Thus, in his forty-seventh year, did the "Bravest of the Brave"
expiate one great error, alien from his natural character, and
unworthy of the general course of his life. If he was sometimes a
stern, he was never an implacable, enemy. Ney was sincere, honest,
blunt even: so far from flattering, he often contradicted him on
whose nod his fortunes depended. He was, with rare exceptions,
merciful to the vanquished; and while so many of his brother
marshals dishonoured themselves by the most barefaced rapine and
extortion, he lived and died poor.</p>
<p>Ney left four sons, two of whom are in the service of his old
friend, Bernadotte.</p>

<h2>NOTES OF A READER.</h2>
<h3>CURIOSITIES OF FRANCE.</h3>
<h4><i>Noted by John Locke</i>.</h4>
<p>At Lyons, "they showed us, upon the top of the hill, a church,
now dedicated to the Virgin, which was formerly a temple of Venus;
near it dwelt Thomas a Becket, when banished from England.... About
half a league from St. Vallier, we saw a house, a little out of the
way, where they say Pilate lived in banishment. We met with the
owner, who seemed to doubt the truth of the story; but told us
there was mosaic work very ancient in one of the floors." At
Montpelier, "I walked, and found them gathering of olives&mdash;a
black fruit, the bigness of an acorn, with which the trees were
thickly hung. All the highways are filled with gamesters at mall,
so that walkers are in some danger of knocks.... Parasols, a pretty
sort of cover for women riding in the sun, made of straw, something
like the fashion of tin covers for dishes.... Monsieur Renaie a
gentleman of the town, in whose <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page424" name="page424"></a>[pg 424]</span> house Sir J. Rushworth
lay, about four years ago, sacrificed a child to the devil&mdash;a
child of a servant of his own, upon a design to get the devil to be
his friend, and help him to get some money. Several murders
committed here since I came, and more attempted; one by a brother
on his sister, in the house where I lay." [This species of crime is
therefore not so new in France as recent cases have induced the
philosophical to imagine.]</p>
<p>"At Toulouse saw the charteraux, very large and fine; saw the
relics at St. Sernin, where they have the greatest store of them
that I have met with; besides others, there are six apostles, and
the head of the seventh; viz. two Jameses, Philip, Simon, Jude,
Barnahas, and the head of Barthelmy. We were told of the wonders
these and other relics had done being carried in procession, but
more especially the head of St. Edward, one of our Kings of
England, which, carried in procession, delivered the town from a
plague some years since....</p>
<p>"At Paris, the bills of mortality usually amount to 19 or
20,000; and they count in the town about 500,000 souls, 50,000 more
than in London, where the bills are less. Qu&aelig;re, whether the
Quakers, Anabaptists, and Jews, that die in London, are reckoned in
the bills of mortality."&mdash;<i>Lord King's Life.</i></p>
<hr />
<h3>ROYAL INCOMES.</h3>
<p>The income of the King of England is somewhat more than
&pound;400,000. per annum; but its amount does not perhaps exceed,
in a duplicate ratio, the receipts of some opulent subjects; and
may be advantageously compared with the French King's revenue, a
civil list of about one million sterling, free from diplomatic,
judicial, and, we believe, from all other extraneous charges. Our
late excellent king's regard for economy led him, in the early part
of his reign, to approve a new arrangement of the civil list
expenditure, by which he accepted of a fixed revenue, in lieu of
those improvable funds which had formerly been appropriated to the
crown. On the revision of the civil list in 1816, it appeared, that
had George III. conducted the entire branch of expenditure with
those funds which had been provided for his predecessors, there
would at that period have remained to the crown a total surplus of
&pound;6,300,000. which sum the public had gained by the change of
provision. <i>Quarterly Review</i>.</p>
<hr />
<h3>BRITISH ALMANAC AND COMPANION.</h3>
<p>Swift, if our memory serves us aright, compares abstracts,
abridgments, and summaries to burning-glasses, and has something
about a full book resembling the tail of a lobster. The French too
have a proverb&mdash;"as full as an egg"&mdash;but these home
similes will hardly give the public an idea of the vast variety of
useful matters which these two <i>Year Books</i> contain.</p>
<p>The <i>Almanac</i>, besides an excellent arrangement,
astronomical, meteorological, and philosophical, contains a list of
common indigenous field plants in flower, and even the taste of the
epicure is consulted in a table of fish in season, at the foot of
each month. The Miscellaneous Register includes nearly all the
Court, Parliament, and other Lists of a Red Book; and a List of
Mail Coach routes direct from London, with the hours of their
arrival at the principal towns, is completeness itself: but how
will these items be deranged by Steam Coaches? Among the Useful
Tables, one of Excise Licenses is especially valuable.</p>
<p>The <i>Companion</i> is even more important in its contents than
last year. An Explanation of the Eras of Ancient and Modern Times,
and of various countries, with a view to the comparison of their
respective dates,&mdash;stands first; next are "Facts pertaining to
the course of the Seasons," under the "Observations of a
Naturalist;" an excellent paper on the Tides; and a concise Natural
History of the Weather&mdash;to be continued in the
<i>Companion</i> for 1831; this is a delightful paper. The
Comparative Scales of Thermometers are next, with a wood-cut of the
Scales and Explanation. We have only room to particularize a
Chronological Table of the principal Geographical Discoveries of
Modern European Nations; a paper on French Measures; and a List of
our Metropolitan Charitable Institutions, their officers, &amp;c.
The Parliamentary Register is as copious as usual; the Chronicle of
the Session is neatly compiled; and a rapid Sketch of Public
Improvements, and a Chronicle of Events of 1829 will be interesting
to all readers. In short, we can scarcely conceive a work that is
likely to be more extensively useful than the present: it concerns
the business of all; it is perhaps less domestic than in previous
years; but as "great wits have short memories," its scientific
helps are not overrated.</p>

<h3>PENITENT LETTER.</h3>
<p>The following letter occurs in Captain Beaver's <i>Memoirs</i>,
said to be written by a runaway pirate:&mdash;</p>
<p>"To Mr. Beaver.&mdash;Sir, I hope that you will parden me for
riteing to you, which I know I am not worthy of, but I hope you
will forgive me for all things past, for I am going to try to get a
passage to the Cape deverds, and then for America. Sir, if you will
be so good as to let me go, I shall be grately ableaght to you.
Sir, I hope you will parden me for running away. Sir, I am your
most obedent umbld <i>servant</i>,</p>
<p>"PETER HAYLES.</p>
<p>"Sir, I do rite with tears in my eyes."</p>
<hr />
<h3>FRENCH TRAVELLERS IN ENGLAND.</h3>
<p>A Frenchman in London, without any knowledge of our language
will cut but a sorry figure, and be more liable to ridicule than an
Englishman in a similar condition in Paris: to wit, the waggish
joke told of the Parisian inquiring for <i>Old Bailey</i>, or
<i>Mr. Bailey, Sen.</i> It is, therefore, quite as requisite that a
Frenchman should be provided with a good French and English
phrase-book, as that an Englishman should have an English and
French Manual. Of the former description is Mr. Leigh's "<i>Recueil
de Phrases utiles aux &eacute;trangers voyageant en
Angleterre</i>," a new and improved edition of which is before us.
It contains every description of information, from the embarkation
at Calais to all the Lions of London&mdash;how to punish a roguish
hackney-coachman&mdash;to criticise Miss Kemble at Covent
Garden&mdash;to write an English letter, or to make out a
washing-bill&mdash;which miscellaneous matters are very useful to
know in a metropolis like ours, where, as the new Lord Mayor told a
countryman the other day, we should consider every stranger a
rogue. Glancing at the <i>f&ecirc;tes</i> or holidays, there is a
woeful falling off from the Parisian list&mdash;in ours only eleven
are given&mdash;but "they manage these things better in
France."</p>
<hr />
<h3>CO-OPERATIVE SOCIETIES.</h3>
<p>In the <i>Quarterly Review</i> (lately published) there is an
excellent paper on these Societies.</p>
<p>Of the spread of these Societies we take this anecdote as an
example:&mdash;"A lady, who became acquainted at Brighton with the
Co-operative Society of that town, and carried away a knowledge of
the scheme, has formed three similar societies!, one at Tunbridge,
one at Hastings, the third we know not where. That at Hastings was,
at the end of July, just thirteen weeks old; it had made a clear
profit of &pound;79. 5<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>. and its returns for the
last week of that month were &pound;104. There are now upwards of
seventy Co-operative Societies in different parts of England, and
they are spreading so rapidly that the probability is that by the
time this number of our Review is published, there will be nearly
one hundred." Upon the system of Co-operation the Editor forcibly
remarks, "It is at present in its infancy&mdash;a cloud no bigger
than a man's hand. Whether it is to dissipate in heat, or gradually
spread over the land and send down refreshing showers on this
parched and withered portion of society, God only knows, and time
only can reveal."</p>
<hr />
<h3>STANDARD OF THE JANISSARIES.</h3>
<p>Odd as it may seem, a <i>soup-kettle</i> is the standard of the
Janissaries, an emblem rather more appropriate for a Court of
Aldermen. Dr. Walsh says that he saw in the streets of
Constantinople, an extraordinary greasy-looking fellow dressed in a
leather jacket, covered over with ornaments of tin, bearing in his
hand a lash of several leather thongs; he was followed by two men,
also fantastically dressed, supporting a pole on their shoulders,
from which hung a large copper kettle. They walked through the main
streets with an air of great authority, and all the people hastily
got out of the way. This he found on inquiry was the soup-kettle of
a corps of Janissaries, and always held in high respect; indeed, so
distinguishing a characteristic of this body is their <i>soup</i>,
that their colonel is called Tchorbadg&eacute;, or the distributor
of soup. Their kettle, therefore, is in fact, their standard, and
whenever that is brought forward, it is the signal of some
desperate enterprize, and in a short time 20,000 men have been
known to rally round their odd insignia of war. Apropos, have they
not something to do with <i>kettle-drums</i>?</p>
<hr />
<h3>HOME COLONIES.</h3>
<p>Workhouses are moral pesthouses, for the encouragement of
idleness and profligacy, where at a great charge to the public, a
host of outcasts are reared and trained for a career of misery. For
these costly and demoralizing establishments, which the English
poor dread even <span class="pagenum"><a id="page426" name=
"page426"></a>[pg 426]</span> more than imprisonment or
transportation&mdash;for</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>"That pauper-palace which they hate to see</i>,"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>we would fain see substituted a <i>district or county
colony</i>, where every able-bodied human being out of employment
might find work and subsistence.&mdash;<i>Quarterly Review.</i></p>
<hr />
<h3>BEWICK, THE ENGRAVER.</h3>
<p>The Duke of Northumberland, when first he called to see Mr.
Bewick's workshops at Newcastle, was not personally known to the
engraver; yet he showed him his birds, blocks, and drawings, as he
did to all, with the greatest liberality and cheerfulness; but on
discovering the high rank of his visiter, exclaimed, "I beg pardon,
my lord, I did not know your grace, and was unaware I had the
honour of talking to so great a man." To which the duke
good-humouredly replied, "You are a much greater man than I am, Mr.
Bewick." To which Bewick, with his ready wit that never failed or
offended, resumed, "No, my lord; but were I Duke of Northumberland,
perhaps I could be."&mdash;<i>Mag. Nat. Hist.</i></p>
<hr />
<h3>FRENCH DRAMA.</h3>
<p>Voltaire, as a dramatic writer, studied only to complete what is
called <i>stage effect</i>; and with him, moreover, originated the
contemptible practice, now so prevalent in France, and once so much
in this country, (and which the Irish triumvirate justly call
'<i>blarneying John Bull</i>,') of flattering the passions, and
pouring incense on the high altar of popular
vanity.&mdash;<i>Foreign Review.</i>&mdash;Nearly all Colman's
comedies have this glaring weakness, although some allowance should
be made for the strong excitement amidst which they were first
produced on our stage.</p>
<hr />
<p>It was a remark of Lord Chatham's, and equally so of Mr.
Burke's, that the occasional use of low words does not detract from
the dignity of true eloquence. Mr. Canning and some of his
successors have, however, ventured to differ from these two great
men.</p>
<hr />
<p>The people of England have, in the last year, consumed one half
more of candles, soap, starch, bricks, sugar, brandy, and one-third
more of tea, than they did only twelve years ago, a date which
seems to most of us recent.&mdash;<i>Finance Article, in Quarterly
Review.</i></p>
<hr class="full" />
<h2>THE ANECDOTE GALLERY</h2>
<h3>DR. SOUTHEY.</h3>
<h3>BALLADS VERSUS BONNETS.</h3>
<h4>(<i>For the Mirror.</i>)</h4>
<p>A Mr. L&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, a respectable straw-hat
manufacturer, from the vicinity of Bond-street, who had dabbled
considerably in the fine arts, in the way of sketches and outlines,
taken at the different watering-places which he visited, determined
on making a tour to the Lakes, "in search of the picturesque."
Desirous of rendering his journey poetically interesting, he
solicited from a friend of his in town, who was acquainted with Dr.
Southey, a letter of introduction to the Laureate, which was
accorded. But the epistle, instead of describing Mr.
L&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; as an artist, merely designated him "an
honest bonnet-maker," who had a <i>penchant</i> for lionizing, and
who desired to be introduced to Dr. Southey in "the way of
business." With this vexatiously facetious and laconic scrawl, poor
Mr. L. made his way to the Lakes, and in due time was ushered into
the Parnassian presence of the author of "Thalaba." The address of
one of Southey's celebrity might well perplex a "man of straw;" and
it had somewhat of this effect on our tradesman-artist; who,
however, according to his own account of the affair, bustled
through pretty tolerably; adopting the <i>nonchalance</i> of
Geoffrey Crayon's uncle on entering a superb
drawing-room&mdash;looking around him with an air of indifference,
which seemed to say, "he had seen <i>finer things</i> in his time."
After some desultory conversation, regarding the heights of hills,
the breadths of lakes, and the curative influence of the
sentimental region on the smoke-dried citizens, mixed with some
elaborate eulogies on the "<i>Colloquies on the Progress and
Prospects of Society</i>," the "last new work" of the Doctor's, he
began to evince a little uneasiness at so much ceremony with a mere
tradesman; which was more than was called for towards even the
modest and retiring "bard of Sheffield," on Mr. Southey's
difficultly-acquired interview with the latter. Mr. L., however,
before parting, thought it due to the poet, as a mark of an
artist's respect for the "classic nine," to present him with a few
sketches of the scenery, which he had already taken. Unrolling a
bundle of drawing paper, Southey, who thought he had been talking
to a bonnet-maker, come to solicit orders, remarked, "Your latest
<i>spring patterns</i>, I suppose?" <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page427" name="page427"></a>[pg 427]</span> "Sir!" faintly
articulated the now-enlightened Mr. L., "I merely beg leave to
present you&mdash;" "Really, Sir," said the impatient poet, "I
thank you sincerely; but I have no taste in selecting bonnets; had
the ladies&mdash;" a sentence which was interrupted by the abashed
and confounded bonnet-maker grasping his hat and drawings, and
hastily wishing the Laureate a good morning.</p>
<p>* * H.</p>
<hr />
<h3>BEST'S MEMS.</h3>
<p>Dr. George Horne was a man of unaffected piety, cheerful temper,
great learning, and, notwithstanding his propensity to jesting,
dignified manners. He was much beloved in Magdalen College, of
which he was president; the chief complaint against him being, that
he did not reside the whole of the time in every year that the
statutes required. He resigned his headship on being promoted from
the Deanery of Canterbury to the See of Norwich; the alleged reason
was, the incompatibility of the duties; though other heads of
houses, when made bishops, have retained their academical
situations. He never manifested the least ill-humour himself, and
repressed it, but with gentleness, in others. Having engaged in a
party at whist, merely because he was wanted to make up the number,
and playing indifferently ill, as he forewarned his partner would
be the case, he replied to the angry question, "What reason could
you possibly have, Mr. President, for playing that card?" "None
upon earth, I assure you." On the morning when news was received in
college of the death of one of the fellows, a good companion, a
<i>bon vivant</i>, Horne met with another fellow, an especial
friend of the defunct, and began to condole with him: "We have lost
poor L&mdash;&mdash;." "Ah! Mr. President, I may well say I could
have better spared a better man." "Meaning <i>me</i>, I suppose?"
said Horne, with an air that, by its pleasantry, put to flight the
other's grief. I was talking with Henry James Pye, late
poet-laureate, when he happened to mention the name of Mr. P., a
gentleman of Berkshire, and M.P. I think, for Reading; "That is the
man," said I, "who damned the king's wig in the very presence of
his majesty; with great credit, however, to his own loyalty, and
very much to the amusement of the king." "I do not well see how
that could be." "You shall hear a story which our president (Pye
had been a gentleman commoner of Magdalen College) told at his own
table. The king was out a hunting; P&mdash;&mdash; was <i>in</i>,
and <i>of</i>, the field; the king's horse fell; the king was
thrown from the saddle, and his hat and wig were thrown to a little
distance from him: he got on his feet again immediately, and began
to look about for the hat and wig, which he did not readily see,
being, as we all know, short-sighted. P&mdash;&mdash;, very much
alarmed by the accident, rides up in great haste and arrives at the
moment when the king is peering about and saying to the attendants,
'Where's my wig? where's my wig?' P&mdash;&mdash; cries out,
'D&mdash;n your wig! is <i>your majesty safe</i>?'"</p>

<h3>CURIOUS CONCEITS.</h3>
<p>While the late Edmund Burke was making preparation for the
indictment before the House of Lords, of Warren Hastings,
Governor-general of India, he was told that a person who had long
resided in the East Indies, but who was then an inmate of Bedlam,
could supply him with much useful information. Burke went
accordingly to Bedlam, was taken to the cell of the maniac, and
received from him, in a long, rational, and well-conducted
conversation, the results of much and various knowledge and
experience in Indian affairs, and much instruction for the process
then intended. On leaving the cell, Burke told the keeper who
attended him, that the poor man whom he had just visited, was most
iniquitously practised upon; for that he was as much in his senses
as man could be. The keeper assured him that there was sufficient
warranty and very good cause for his confinement. Burke, with what
a man in office once called "Irish impetuosity," known to be one of
Burke's characteristics, insisted that it was an infamous affair,
threatened to make the matter public, or even bring it before
parliament. The keeper then said, "Sir, I should be sorry for you
to leave this house under a false impression: before you do so, be
pleased to step back to the poor gentleman's cell, and ask him what
he had for breakfast." Burke could not refuse compliance with a
request so reasonable and easily performed. "Pray, Sir," says he to
his Indian counsellor, "be so obliging as to tell me what you had
for breakfast." The other, immediately putting on the wild stare of
the maniac, cried out, "Hobnails, Sir! It is shameful to think how
they treat us! They give us nothing but hobnails!" and went on with
a "descant wild" on the horrors of the cookery of Bethlehem
Hospital. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page428" name=
"page428"></a>[pg 428]</span> Burke staid no longer than that his
departure might not seem abrupt; and, on the advantage of the first
pause in the talk, was glad to make his escape. I was present when
Paley was much interested and amused by an account given by one of
the company, of a widow lady, who was of entirely sound mind,
except that she believed herself made of glass. Given the
vitrification, her conduct and discourse were consequent and
rational, according to the particulars which Paley drew forth by
numerous questions. Canes and parasols were deposited at the door
of her drawing-room as at the Louvre or Florentine Gallery, and for
the same reason. "You may be hurt by a blow," said she, to one of
flesh and blood; "but I should be broken to pieces: and how could I
be mended?"&mdash;<i>Best's Mems.</i></p>

<p>More than one acknowledgment is due from us to this excellent
work, although the publishers may doubt our sincerity by our
selecting the following interesting Ballad, from the German of
Christian Count Stolberg; which, observes the reviewer, "is by some

<h3>A FEARFUL PROSPECT.</h3>
<h4>(<i>From the "Noctes" of Blackwood.</i>)</h4>
<p><i>Shepherd</i>.&mdash;I look to the mountains, Mr. North, and
stern they staun' in a glorious gloom, for the sun is strugglin'
wi' a thunder-cloud, and facing him a faint but fast-brightenin'
rainbow. The ancient spirit o' Scotland comes on me frae the sky;
and the sowl within me reswears in silence the oath o' the
Covenant. There they are&mdash;the Covenanters a' gather'd
thegither, no in fear and tremblin', but wi' Bibles in their
bosoms, and swords by their sides, in a glen deep as the sea, and
still as death, but for the soun' o' a stream and the cry o' an
eagle. "Let us sing, to the praise and glory o' God, the hundred
psalm," quoth a loud clear voice, though it be the voice o' an auld
man; and up to Heaven hands he his strang wither'd hauns, and in
the gracious wunds o' heaven are flying abroad his gray hairs', or
say rather, white as the silver or the snaw.</p>
<p><i>North</i>.&mdash;Oh, for Wilkie!</p>
<p><i>Shepherd</i>.&mdash;The eagle and the stream are silent, and
the heavens and the earth are brocht close thegither by that
triumphin' psalm. Ay, the clouds cease their sailing and lie still;
the mountains bow their heads; and the crags, do they not seem to
listen, as in that remote place the hour o' the delighted day is
filled with a holy hymn to the Lord God o' Israel!</p>
<p><i>North</i>.&mdash;My dear Shepherd!</p>
<p><i>Shepherd</i>.&mdash;Oh! if there should be sittin'
there&mdash;even in that congregation on which, like God's own eye,
looketh down the meridian sun, now shinin' in the blue
region&mdash;an Apostate!</p>
<p><i>North</i>.&mdash;The thought is terrible.</p>
<p><i>Shepherd</i>.&mdash;But na, na, na! See that bonny blue-e'ed,
rosy-cheek'd, gowden-haired lassie,&mdash;only a thought paler than
usual, sweet lily that she is,&mdash;half sittin' half lyin' on the
greensward, as she leans on the knee o' her stalwart
grand-father&mdash;for the sermon's begun, and all eyes are
fastened on the preacher&mdash;look at her till your heart melts,
as if she were your ain, and God had given you that beautifu' wee
image o' her sainted mother, and tell me if you think that a' the
tortures that cruelty could devise to inflict, would ever ring frae
thae sweet innocent lips ae word o' abjuration o' the faith in
which the flower is growing <span class="pagenum"><a id="page430"
name="page430"></a>[pg 430]</span> up amang the dew-draps o' her
native hills?</p>
<p><i>North</i>.&mdash;Never&mdash;never&mdash;never!</p>
<p><i>Shepherd</i>.&mdash;She proved it, sir, in death. Tied to a
stake on the sea-sands she stood; and first she heard, and then she
saw, the white roarin' o' the tide. But the smile forsook not her
face; it brichten'd in her een when the water reach'd her knee;
calmer and calmer was her voice of prayer, as it beat again' her
bonny breast; nae shriek when a wave closed her lips for ever; and
methinks, sir,&mdash;for ages on ages hae lapsed awa' sin' that
martyrdom, and therefore Imagination may withouten blame dally wi'
grief&mdash;methinks, sir, that as her golden head disappear'd,
'twas like a star sinkin' in the sea!</p>
<p><i>North</i>.&mdash;God bless you, my dearest James! shake
hands.</p>

<h2>SPIRIT OF DISCOVERY</h2>
<hr />
<h3>POPULAR PHILOSOPHY.</h3>
<h4><i>Dr. Arnott's Elements of Physics.</i></h4>
<h4>Vol. ii. Part I.</h4>
<p>We are warm friends to the diffusion of knowledge, and
accordingly receive the present portion of Dr. Arnott's work with
much satisfaction. We believe the sale of the first volume to have
been almost unprecedentedly rapid, (a <i>fourth</i> edition being
called for within two years) in comparison with the usual slow sale
of <i>scientific</i> works. This success may easily be traced. The
title of the work is not extraordinarily inviting, illustration,
not embellishment, is attempted in a few outline diagrams, and the
only external inducement to read, is a plain, legible type, to suit
all sights. Looking further, we find the great cause in the manner
as well as the matter of the volume, which is throughout a
text-book of <i>plain-spoken philosophy</i>, or as the author says
in his title-page, "independently of technical mathematics." Again,
in his introductory chapter on "Imponderable Substances," he says,
"To understand the subjects as far as men yet usefully understand
them, and sufficiently for a vast number of most useful purposes,
it is only necessary to classify important phenomena, so that their
nature and resemblances may be clearly perceived." The main error
of most people who write on philosophical subjects, or the
stumbling-block of all students, has been that of the writer
presuming too much upon the cultivated understanding of his reader.
Thus, in the midst of very familiar explanations we have often seen
technicalities which must operate as a wet blanket on the
enthusiasm of the reader; and break up the charm which the subject
had hitherto created. Upon this principle, treatise upon treatise
has been published without effecting the primary object. The matter
of Dr. Arnott's work, however, appears to us to be in strict
accordance with its title&mdash;elementary; but it is accompanied
with a variety of explanations of familiar facts on philosophical
principles, which possess attractions of a most amusive
character.</p>
<p>The present portion of Dr. Arnott's work comprehends the
subjects of <i>Light</i> and <i>Heat</i>, which admit of more
familiar illustration than any other branches of Natural
Philosophy. Of this advantage the author has fully availed himself
in a variety of familiar exemplars, which, to speak seriously are
brought home to our very firesides. A few of these facts will form
a recreative page or two for another MIRROR: in the meantime we
quote a few illustrative observations on the most interesting
exhibitions of the day:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Common paintings and prints may be considered as parts of a
panoramic representation, showing as much of that general field of
view which always surrounds a spectator, as can be seen by the eye
turned in one direction, and looking through a window or other
opening. The pleasure from contemplating these is much increased by
using a lens. There is such a lens fitted up in the shops, with the
title of <i>optical pillar machine</i>, or <i>diagonal mirror</i>,
and the print to be viewed is laid upon a table beyond the stand of
the lens, and its reflection in a mirror supported diagonally over
it, is viewed through the lens. The illusion is rendered more
complete in such a case by having a box to receive the painting on
its bottom, and where the lens and mirror, fixed in a smaller box
above, are made to slide up and down in their place to allow of
readily adjusting the focal distance. This box used in a reverse
way becomes a perfect camera obscura. The common show-stalls seen
in the streets are boxes made somewhat on this principle, but
without the mirror; and although the drawings or prints in them are
generally very coarse, they are not uninteresting. To children
whose eyes are not yet very critical, some of these show boxes
afford an exceeding great treat."</p>
<p><i>Cosmoramas and Dioramas.</i></p>
<p>"A still more perfect contrivance of the same kind has been
exhibited for some time in London and Paris under the title of
<i>Cosmorama</i> (from Greek <span class="pagenum"><a id="page431"
name="page431"></a>[pg 431]</span> words signifying <i>views</i> of
the <i>world</i>, because of the great variety of views.) Pictures
of moderate size are placed beyond what have the appearance of
common windows, but of which the panes are really large convex
lenses fitted to correct the errors of appearance which the
nearness of the pictures would else produce. Then by farther using
various subordinate contrivances, calculated to aid and heighten
the effects, even shrewd judges have been led to suppose the small
pictures behind the glasses to be very large pictures, while all
others have let their eyes dwell upon them with admiration, as
magical realizations of the natural scenes and objects. Because
this contrivance is cheap and simple, many persons affect to
despise it; but they do not thereby show their wisdom; for to have
made so perfect a representation of objects, is one of the most
sublime triumphs of art, whether we regard the pictures drawn in
such true perspective and colouring, or the lenses which assist the
eye in examining them.</p>
<p>"It has already been stated, that the effect of such glasses in
looking at near pictures, is obtainable in a considerable degree
without a glass, by making the pictures very large and placing them
at a corresponding distance. The rule of proportion in such a case
is, that a picture of one foot square at one foot distance from the
eye, appears as large as a picture of sixty feet square at sixty
feet distance. The exhibition called the Diorama is merely a large
painting prepared in accordance with the principle now explained.
In principle it has no advantage over the cosmorama or the show
box, to compensate for the great expense incurred, but that many
persons may stand before it at a time, all very near the true point
of sight, and deriving the pleasure of sympathy in their admiration
of it, while no slight motion of the spectator can make the eye
lose its point of view."</p>
<p><i>The Colosseum.</i></p>
<p>"A round building of prodigious magnitude has lately been
erected in the Regent's Park, in London, on the walls of which is
painted a representation of London and the country around, as seen
from the cross on the top of St. Paul's Cathedral. The scene taken
altogether is unquestionably one of the most extraordinary which
the whole world affords, and this representation combines the
advantages of the circular view of the panorama, the size and
distance of the great diorama, and of the details being so minutely
painted, that distant objects may be examined by a telescope or
opera-glass.</p>
<p>"From what has now been said, it may be understood, that for the
purpose of representing still-nature, or mere momentary states of
objects in motion, a picture truly drawn, truly coloured, and which
is either very large to correct the divergence of light and
convergence of visual axes, or if small, as viewed through a glass,
would affect the retina exactly as the realities. But the
desideratum still remained of being able to paint motion. Now this
too has been recently accomplished, and in many cases with singular
felicity, by making the picture transparent, and throwing lights
and shadows upon it from behind. In the exhibitions of the diorama
and cosmorama there have been represented with admirable truth and
beauty such phenomena as&mdash;the sun-beams occasionally
interrupted by passing clouds, and occasionally darting through the
windows of a cathedral and illuminating the objects in its
venerable interior&mdash;the rising and disappearing of mist over a
beautiful landscape, runningwater, as for instance the cascades
among the sublime precipices of Mount St. Gothard in
Switzerland;&mdash;and most surprising of all, a fire or
conflagration. In the cosmorama of Regent-street, the great fire of
Edinburgh was admirably represented:&mdash;first that fine city was
seen sleeping in darkness while the fire began, then the
conflagration grew and lighted up the sky, and soon at short
intervals, as the wind increased, or as roofs fell in, there were
bursts of flame towering to heaven, and vividly reflected from
every wall or spire which caught the direct light&mdash;then the
clouds of smoke were seen rising in rapid succession and sailing
northward upon the wind, until they disappeared in the womb of
distant darkness. No one can have viewed that appalling scene with
indifference, and the impression left by the representation, on
those who knew the city, can scarcely have been weaker than that
left on those who saw the reality. The mechanism for producing such
effects is very simple; but spectators, that they may fully enjoy

<p>Even for the present we cannot omit mention of the delight with
which we have read several of the more playful portions of the
present work; we allude to such passages as the Influence of Heat
on Animated Beings, in which Dr. Arnott has really blended the
pencil of the artist with the pen of the philosopher, and thus
produced many sketches of extreme picturesque beauty.</p>

against such odds, one of the merchants proposed arming the
prisoners: accordingly, swords, poniards, and pistols, were
distributed amongst them, and, by imitating their masters, these
grotesque auxiliaries succeeded in putting their aggressors to

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234
